## About LiveWhale UI

LiveWhale UI is a collection of jQuery plugins used by the [LiveWhale](http://www.livewhale.net) content management system.  The plugins are written as extensions of the [jQuery UI 1.10 widget factory](http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/), which provides a common framework for a number of functions including state management, method creation, and custom events.  The LiveWhale UI plugins are written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), and the library is tested and built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

While the plugins are written for LiveWhale, they are intended for general use, and have no requirements other than the following dependencies.
