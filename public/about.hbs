LiveWhale UI is a collection of jQuery plugins developed for [LiveWhale CMS](http://www.livewhale.net).  The plugins are written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), and each inherits from the [jQuery UI 1.10 Widget Factory](http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/), which provides a framework that simplifies plugin development, and standardizes API interactions.  

## Dependencies

* jQuery >= 1.8
* jQuery UI 1.10 Widget Factory

## Contributing

```
$ git clone git@github.com:whitewhale/LiveWhaleUI.git
$ cd LiveWhaleUI 
$ npm install
```

### TODO

Lots to do still.  Explain website structure, assemble grunt package, and grunt watch.
