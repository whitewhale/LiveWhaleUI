LiveWhale UI is a collection of jQuery plugins developed for [LiveWhale CMS](http://www.livewhale.net).  The plugins are written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), and each inherits from the [jQuery UI 1.10 Widget Factory](http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/), which provides a framework that simplifies plugin development, and standardizes API interactions.  

## Dependencies

* jQuery >= 1.8
* jQuery UI 1.10 Widget Factory


## Usage in LiveWhale  

We use this project to package the core libraries that LiveWhale depends on, both for its back-end and for pages generated by LiveWhale.  For each environment, a grunt process combines the libraries used in the environment into a single file.  The following is a list of what each contains. 

### frontend.js and frontend.min.js

* [jQuery UI Widget Factory](http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/)
* [Imagesloaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded)
* [LiveWhale UI Overlay](/overlay.html)
* [LiveWhale UI Slideshow](/slideshow.html)

### backend.js and backend.min.js

* [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/)
* [Imagesloaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded)
* [jQuery BBQ](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/)
* [LiveWhale UI Overlay](/overlay.html)
* [LiveWhale UI Popover](/popover.html)
* [LiveWhale UI Timepicker](/timepicker.html)
* [LiveWhale UI Slideshow](/slideshow.html)

We also use this project to maintain LiveWhale's copies of jQuery and jQuery UI, which we modify slightly to prevent name conflicts.

The following will update LiveWhale with the latest LiveWhale UI changes.

```
$ grunt release
$ grunt copy_to_lw --lwdir={path_to_livewhale}
```

## Contributing 

To contribute to LiveWhale UI, make sure you have node v0.10 or greater and grunt-cli installed, and run the following in your terminal. 

```
$ git clone git@github.com:whitewhale/LiveWhaleUI.git
$ cd LiveWhaleUI 
$ npm install
```

### TODO

Lots to do still.  Explain website structure, assemble grunt package, and grunt watch.
