title: Use in LiveWhale
---

{{#markdown}}

White Whale uses this project to both maintain its own plugins and to package many of the third-party Javascript libraries that LiveWhale depends on.  The project's grunt file defindes tasks for combining these libraries into aggregate files, one for the front-end and another for the back-end.  The following is a list of libraries contained in each of these files. 

### frontend.js

* [jQuery UI Widget Factory](http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/)
* [Imagesloaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded)
* [LiveWhale UI Overlay](/overlay.html)
* [LiveWhale UI Slideshow](/slideshow.html)

### backend.js

* [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/)
* [Imagesloaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded)
* [jQuery BBQ](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/)
* [LiveWhale UI Overlay](/overlay.html)
* [LiveWhale UI Hoverbox](/hoverbox.html)
* [LiveWhale UI Timepicker](/timepicker.html)
* [LiveWhale UI Slideshow](/slideshow.html)

We also use this project to maintain LiveWhale's copies of jQuery and jQuery UI, which we modify slightly to prevent name conflicts.

The following will update LiveWhale with the latest LiveWhale UI changes.

```
$ grunt release
$ grunt copy_to_lw --lwdir={path_to_livewhale}
```
